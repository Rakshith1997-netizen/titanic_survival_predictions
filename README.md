## 🧠 Problem Statement

Using historical data from the Titanic passenger list, the goal is to build a classifier that predicts survival based on features like:

- Age
- Sex
- Passenger class
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- And more...

---

## 🛠️ ML Stack Used

- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn (SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Feature engineering

---

## 🎯 Goal

Achieve high accuracy and learn practical steps in a full ML pipeline — from data cleaning to submission-ready predictions.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Run the notebook `surviv.ipynb` from start to end.  
It walks through:

- Data exploration
- Preprocessing
- Model selection
- Final prediction output
